# Altstadtmarkt  
The Altstadtmarkt is one of the islands of tradition. It features the Gewandhaus, the Altstadtrathaus, the Rüninger Zollhaus, and St. Martini Church.  

## Gewandhaus  
The Gewandhaus was built in 1303 and long served as the trading and storage house for clothiers. In 1329, it received a wine cellar and, in 1352, was granted the right to serve alcohol. This makes it one of the oldest hospitality cellars in Lower Saxony.  

In the Middle Ages, patrons enjoyed beer, wine, and *Braunschweiger Mumme* (a malt extract) there. At times, the Gewandhaus also served as the city's armory (for storing cannons).  

The eastern façade displays the Braunschweig Lion. Meanwhile, the Rüninger Zollhaus features a Renaissance portal, originally part of the Hagenmarkt Apotheke. The Rüninger Zollhaus was once located in the southern part of Braunschweig but was relocated here as part of the *islands of tradition*. Today, the tollhouse stands in the heart of the city.  

## Altstadtrathaus  
As its name suggests, the Altstadtrathaus (Old Town Hall) was the administrative center of the Altstadt district. It was built in the 13th century, and its façade displays 17 sculptures of rulers from the Ottonian and Welf dynasties. A notable feature of the Ottonian emperors is that they are depicted alongside their wives.  

Inside the Altstadtrathaus is the *Dornse*, which translates to "heated room." This reflects a time when heating in every home was not yet standard—at least not until Robert Habeck arrives with his hammer to remove them. How he plans to manage that alone is anyone's guess. Maybe I should offer him my help.  

On one of the pillars in the arcade, you’ll find the *Braunschweiger Elle*—the official length measure used by Braunschweig merchants. The *Braunschweiger Elle* dates back to the 16th century and is 57.07 cm long.
