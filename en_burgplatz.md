# Burgplatz  
Burgplatz is another island of tradition, a miniature model of which can be found in front of the cathedral (*Dom*).  

The Dankwarderode Castle was the residence of Henry the Lion (*Heinrich der Löwe*), one of the most significant figures in Braunschweig’s history and the reason why lions are seen throughout the city.  

Henry the Lion was born around 1130 in Ravensburg and died in 1195 in Braunschweig. He belonged to the Welf dynasty, one of Europe’s most prominent noble families, and served as Duke of Saxony and Duke of Bavaria during his lifetime. Henry was married to Matilda, the daughter of the King of England. Dankwarderode Castle was built after their wedding and was intended to overshadow the Imperial Palace in Goslar.  

Henry the Lion was an ally and cousin of Frederick Barbarossa, the Holy Roman Emperor. Barbarossa’s father was a Hohenstaufen, while his mother came from the Welf dynasty, like Henry. These two families were rivals for power within the Holy Roman Empire. Barbarossa granted Henry Bavaria to secure his support, as bavaria had originally belonged to Henry’s father but was inherited by Barbarossa. In return, Henry helped Barbarossa consolidate his power.  

This historical connection explains why lions are also a common symbol in Munich (München). The city’s name, "Munich," was first mentioned in a treaty between Henry and Barbarossa as "bei den Mönchen" ("near the monks").  

Both Barbarossa and Henry are considered legendary power figures of the 12th century. However, their legacy was later co-opted by the Nazis, who celebrated them as heroes, further tying Braunschweig to its role in the Nazi era.  

The lion is Braunschweig’s emblem and stands prominently on the cathedral square (*Domplatz*). However, this lion is a replica; the original is kept inside the castle. Kurt Seeleke, the creator of the *Traditionsinseln*, famously swapped the original lion for a replica in a secret operation without informing the Nazi leadership. He hid the original in the Rammelsberg mines near Goslar, protecting it from wartime bombing.  

The lion was featured on the 5 Reichsmark banknote during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler was fascinated by Henry the Lion and had the tombs of Henry and his wife Matilda opened in the cathedral in 1935, declaring it a pilgrimage site or "sacred place of the nation."  

Interestingly, in the 12th century, no one knew what a lion truly looked like. The anatomy of the statue is thus somewhat peculiar, based on drawings and other lion statues, primarily from Italy. This is especially noticeable from the front, where the statue resembles bears or dogs more than lions. Its posture is also unnatural.  

Why does the lion face the "wrong" direction? Why does it look toward the castle? The answer lies in its orientation: it faces east—a symbol of Henry the Lion’s ambitions to expand his power in that direction.  

In front of the cathedral, benches are adorned with various playful lion heads, further celebrating the city’s iconic symbol.
