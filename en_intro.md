# Braunschweig
When thinking about which German cities you absolutely must visit, I’m sure you’ll immediately think of places like Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, or Munich. But Braunschweig? Probably not. However, you’ve landed in this city today, and you’ll see that this underdog can compete with the best of them.

Here’s what you need to know about Braunschweig: it’s a patchwork city. After World War II, there were two main paradigms in urban planning: reconstruction—Munich serves as an example of this—and transformation into a car-friendly city, exemplified by Hanover. Braunschweig lies somewhere in between. Today, we’ll encounter neighborhoods that seem historically quaint, but we’ll also see an unsettling extent of land sealing—even in places most consider Braunschweig’s most beautiful.

## Traditionsinseln
Braunschweig wasn’t always a single city; it originally consisted of five districts called Weichbilder: Altewiek, Altstadt, Neustadt, Hagen, and Sack.

Until the start of World War II, most of the medieval cityscape remained completely intact. However, that era came to a definitive end on October 15, 1944, when a massive firestorm following an air raid destroyed 90% of the city. For nearly three days, the city burned—most of its half-timbered houses were highly flammable.

Faced with the extensive destruction, Braunschweig’s chief heritage conservator, Kurt Seeleke, developed the concept of Traditionsinseln ("islands of tradition"). These are historical areas preserved or reconstructed amid modern buildings. The five islands of tradition are:

- Ägidienviertel
- Altstadtmarkt
- Burgplatz
- Magniviertel
- Michaelisviertel

The concept has its critics. It’s often described as a sort of open-air museum that doesn’t reflect reality. Some buildings were dismantled from their original locations and rebuilt within these islands of tradition, meaning historical authenticity is, in some cases, only simulated. Additionally, elements were inserted into houses where they never originally belonged.
