# Kohlmarkt  

## On the Way: Katttreppeln  
"Where the Cats Fight" (*Wo sich die Katzen raufen*) is an artwork by Siegfried Neuenhausen, a former professor at the Braunschweig University of Art. Neuenhausen is one of the most prominent figures in the art scene of Lower Saxony.  

## Kohlmarkt  
Contrary to what the name suggests, the *Kohlmarkt* ("Cabbage Market") was not a market for cabbages. The *forum carborum* was instead a storage and trade center for coal.  

On the square, you can see the outline of an old church that has stood elsewhere since the 16th century under the name "Brüdernkirche St. Ulrici." Additionally, three beautiful houses catch the eye: *Haus zum Stern* (House of the Star), *Haus zur Rose* (House of the Rose), and *Haus zur Sonne* (House of the Sun).  

Today, Kohlmarkt is primarily used for events and as an outdoor seating area for many cafés.  

## Gewandhaus  
To the west, you can spot the Gewandhaus located on Altstadtmarkt.
