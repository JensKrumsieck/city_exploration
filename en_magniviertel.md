# Magniviertel  

## Magnikirchplatz  
The Magniviertel is considered the oldest district in Braunschweig—or more accurately, in Altewiek—and is one of the city's "tradition islands." Braunschweig was once Germany's largest half-timbered city, and this district provides a glimpse of what the city might have looked like in the past.  

At the center of this square is the Magnikirche, consecrated in 1031. The church’s consecration document is the first known mention of the name "Braunschweig," or its earlier form, "Brunesguik."  

Many historical landmarks surround the district, including the Magnitor, a gateway on the former trade route to Magdeburg, and the Löwenwall, a park featuring a large obelisk commemorating the Wars of Liberation during Napoleon I's occupation.  

Today, the Magniviertel is not only a showcase for excellent urban traffic policies but also a popular nightlife area. The street "Ölschlägern," where we stand now, was converted into a pedestrian zone just a few years ago, significantly improving the area's quality of life. Smart one-way street regulations aim to make other streets in the district as car-free as possible.  

## The Red Castle  
The Magniviertel is also home to Braunschweig's oldest half-timbered house, located at Ackerhof 2, which was built in 1432. Directly across from it stands the Volksfreundhaus, also known as the "Red Castle." While the Green Party headquarters are located at Ägidienmarkt, this building has served as the SPD headquarters since 1914.  

In 1933, the SPD was expropriated by the Nazis, its archives and books burned, and the Volksfreundhaus turned into a place of terror. Party members and trade unionists were detained, tortured, and killed there.  

> Am 9.3.1933 stürmte die zwei Tage vorher aus SA und SS aufgestellte "Hilfspolizei" das Volksfreundhaus, inhaftierte, folterte und tötete Gegner. Mehrere Tage lang brannte auf dem Ackerhof ein Scheiterhaufen, auf dem die Bücher der Volksbuchhandlung, das gesamte SPD-Parteiarchiv, die Akten der Gewerkschaften und anderer Verbände vernichtet wurden.

> On March 9, 1933, the "auxiliary police," formed just two days earlier from SA and SS members, stormed the Volksfreundhaus, arrested, tortured, and killed opponents. For several days, a pyre burned at Ackerhof, consuming books from the SPD's bookshop, the party archive, and trade union records.  

This was one of the Nazis' first book burning in Germany. A second took place at Schlossplatz, where a commemorative "stumbling threshold" marks the site today. *"Where they burn books, they will also ultimately burn people."* —Heinrich Heine  

Why Braunschweig? The city was intended to be a "model Nazi city." Since 1930, a coalition of the "Citizen's Unified List" and the NSDAP had governed, with politics and police already under Nazi control. In 1932, Adolf Hitler was naturalized as a German citizen in Braunschweig. Torture as a tool led to a wave of resignations from political mandates. By late April 1933, the first "purely National Socialist parliament" was reportedly in session.  

Braunschweig was also a center for arms production. Today’s Salzgitter AG was then known as Reichswerke Herrmann Göring, and Peine was already processing steel. Fallersleben—now Wolfsburg—did not yet exist but was turned into the "KZ-Arbeitsdorf" (concentration camp labor village) for the Volkswagen factory. Wolfsburg was founded in 1938 and called "Stadt des KdF-Wagens bei Fallersleben" ("City of the Strength Through Joy Car at Fallersleben") until 1945.  

## Happy Rizzi House  
The Happy Rizzi House was designed by James Rizzi and opened in 2001. It is a popular photo spot for tourists. The building houses offices, including the headquarters of the fashion brand New Yorker. The company's owner, Friedrich Knapp, who recently passed away, was one of Braunschweig's wealthiest residents. Knapp lived in the Villa Rimpau on Wolfenbütteler Straße, which had been occupied by the Nazis during World War II and called the "Adolf-Hitler-Haus." Knapp purchased the villa in 2006.
