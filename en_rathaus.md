# Rathaus  
The town hall (Rathaus) is located close to the castle on the Platz der Deutschen Einheit. In front of the police building, you can spot a piece of the Berlin Wall.  

The Rathaus was constructed by Ludwig Winter and is not a historical building, having been completed for the first time in 1900. The town hall tower stands 61 meters tall and was inspired by buildings from Flanders, Belgium.  

Ludwig Winter, a city building councilor, played a significant role in the reconstruction of many buildings, including Dankwarderode Castle.
