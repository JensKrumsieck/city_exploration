# Ringerbrunnen  
The story of the Ringerbrunnen (Wrestlers' Fountain) is one of my favorites because of its absurdity. It is not a historical tale but a story about Braunschweig sculptor Prof. Jürgen Weber from 1974. This location was once the marketplace of the Sack district.  

Jürgen Weber was commissioned to design a "water art" piece for this square. However, when he presented his plaster model of two naked wrestlers, it sparked months of heated debate. The sculpture depicted two wrestlers fighting on a lion’s skin, representing the mythological battle between the giant Antaeus and Hercules (Herakles). Antaeus, known for eating lions, was invincible as long as his feet touched the ground. Hercules defeated him by lifting him off the ground and killing him.  

Due to criticism, particularly from the city council, Weber modified the original design. He dressed the wrestlers in trikots. Hercules’ trikot bore the initials "JW" for Jürgen Weber, while Antaeus' trikot displayed the names of Weber’s loudest critics. Hercules stands on a lion’s head—Braunschweig’s symbol—and Weber symbolically wipes his feet on the lion. Thus, the sculpture now represents Weber’s struggle with his critics and the city of Braunschweig rather than the mythological story.  

Weber kept the revised version a secret until its unveiling on August 15, 1975. Critics were stunned to see their names on the sculpture. One attendee laughed first, and eventually, everyone joined in.
