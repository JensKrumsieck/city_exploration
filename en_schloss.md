# Schloss  
The Schloss (castle) is not a truly historical building. Its current form was completed in 2007 and is referred to as the "third construction." The first castle stood from 1717 to 1830 in the eastern part of the city and looked entirely different. The current design is modeled after the second castle, which stood here from 1841 to 1960.  

Atop the Schloss stands a quadriga, larger than the one on Berlinâ€™s Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburger Tor). It has been in place since late 2008 and is nearly 10 meters tall.  

Between 1960 and 2007, this area was a park. Today, it represents a vast expanse of impervious surface. Summers here are extremely hot, and in winter, the ground is dangerously slippery. Our tour thus concludes at one of the most poorly designed public spaces in terms of urban planning and environmental considerations.
